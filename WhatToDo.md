# k9-arduino
The code for Arduino-based K9 Robot.
# k9.ino
The main file for your K9 is K9.ino. If you have setup the aprropriate hardware, download then upload this sketch and watch as your robot does all K9-like functions. Feel free to modify this code.
When this code is released a short 'Function Guide' will accompany.
This will include how to use your robot as well as hidden features.
The main sketch also features extensive commentary on how the code works. For a standalone copy find howcodeworks.txt.

# K9 Scripts

This library of scripts contain all the functions that the main sketch does but very much broken down. For example, PIR Serial tests the PIR and outputs data to the serial monitor. Eye-Final puts PIR, Eye-Standby and Startup together and will make an LED blink accordingly.
The Scripts are alos extensively commentated.
