### K9 OS
## K9 Software and Iterations for use with the K9 Robot
# Releases

# K9 Scripts

This library of scripts contain all the functions that the main sketch does but very much broken down. For example, PIR Serial tests the PIR and outputs data to the serial monitor. Eye-Final puts PIR, Eye-Standby and Startup together and will make an LED blink accordingly.
The Scripts are alos extensively commentated.
