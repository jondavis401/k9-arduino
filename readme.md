# K9 OS
## Operating System and Scripts for a custom and intuitive OS for K9
### Releases

This library of scripts contain all the functions that the main sketch does but very much broken down. For example, PIR Serial tests the PIR and outputs data to the serial monitor. Eye-Final puts PIR, Eye-Standby and Startup together and will make an LED blink accordingly.	
The Scripts are alos extensively commentated.
